# Ionic lists app üöÄ

This repository is part of a set of exercises that I have done in the context of Fernando Herrera's Advanced Angular courses.
This project, implemented with Ionic v5, is a PWA that allows to make a list management. They can be marked as completed or not and has a native interaction with Android.

To be able to use the application you have to clone the repository to local and to run it:
* npm install
* ng serve

## Build with üõ†Ô∏è

* Ionic v5
* Angular 9
* RXJS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Typescript
